# Developer: Simeon

### Tasks Completed:

## JobPosting

- Documented the code and logic in detail

## ATS Config
- Implemented ATSConfig CRUD controllers and routes  
- Used Mongoose schema for employer-specific ATS configurations  
- Enforced unique constraint (one config per employer)  
- Added support for dynamic screening criteria, weightings, and auto-reject rules  
- Included optional fields like `notes` and `enabled`  
- Tested all endpoints using cURL requests  
- Documented the code and logic in detail  

## ATS Filter Logic and match candidiate job
- Implemented complete ATS filtering logic using dynamic criteria, operators, and values  
- Built a weighted scoring system based on employer-defined weightings  
- Created auto-reject rules to disqualify candidates instantly if they fail critical criteria  
- Developed candidate-job matching algorithm with detailed score breakdown  
- Implemented job suggestions logic that ranks jobs for a candidate  
- Created reusable helper functions for experience calculation, education mapping, skills matching, etc.  
- Built controllers and routes for all endpoints  
- Tested all logic with cURL requests  

## ATS filter logic and match candidate job
- Implemented full ATSConfig CRUD functionality  
- Built candidate filtering logic using dynamic criteria and auto-reject rules  
- Created weighted match scoring system based on employer-defined preferences  
- Developed job ranking and batch application processing endpoints  
- Added statistics endpoint to track employer-wide ATS usage  
- Integrated validation (`Joi`) and sanitization (`xss`) across all modules  
- Used Mongoose models for Employer, JobPost, Candidate, and ATSConfig  
- Secured data before inserting into MongoDB  
- Tested all endpoints using cURL  

## Employer
- Implemented full Employer CRUD functionality with enhanced security  
- Secured data using `Joi` validation and `xss` sanitization  
- Integrated file upload support using Cloudinary  
- Stored valid `profile_image` URLs in MongoDB  
- Validated referenced documents (`user_Id`, `job_Postings`)  
- Enforced unique constraint on `user_Id`  
- Handled form data parsing for nested objects like `contact_Person`, `address`  
- Added ObjectId format validation for secure updates  
- Used Mongoose timestamps and structured JSON responses  
- Built and tested routes using Express  

## Employer Applications (Authorized)
- Implemented a secure controller and route for employers to fetch all their applications.
- Endpoint: `GET /api/employers/applications`
- Returns all applications for the authenticated employer, including:
  - Candidate details (full name, profile image, location, credentials, resume data, applications, training progress, interview schedule)
  - Application details (current stage, applied date, feedback, assessment)
  - Job title for each application
  - Resume URL
  - Total number of applications
- Only accessible to authenticated users with the Employer role.
- Populates all referenced fields and structures the response for easy frontend consumption.
- Fully tested with cURL and Postman.

### Routes:

- `DELETE /job-posts/:id` – Delete a job post

## ATS Config
- `POST /ats-configs` – Create a new ATS config  
- `GET /ats-configs/:employerId` – Get ATS config by employer ID  
- `GET /ats-configs` – List all configs (with optional filters)  
- `PUT /ats-configs/:employerId` – Update an existing config  
- `DELETE /ats-configs/:employerId` – Delete a config  

## ATS filter logic and match candidate job
- `GET /config/:employerId` – Get employer’s ATS config  
- `PUT /config/:employerId` – Update ATS config  
- `POST /jobs/:jobId/filter` – Filter candidates for a job

### Notes:

## JobPosting
- All schemas use ES Module syntax (`import/export`)
- Fixed issue with async `default` on `createdAt` using Mongoose middleware
- Added `pre('save')` hook to set `createdAt` using `fetchTime()`

## ATSConfig
- Each employer can have only one ATS config  
- Criteria and auto-reject rules are stored as arrays of objects for flexibility  
- Ready to move on to Candidate-Job Matching Logic and Job Suggestions API  

## ATS Filter Logic and match candidiate job
- All logic uses ES Module syntax (`import/export`)  
- Candidate data is matched against job requirements and employer preferences  
- Used Mongoose models for Candidate, JobPost, Employer, and ATSConfig  

## ATS filter logic and match candidate job
- All logic uses ES Module syntax (`import/export`)  
- Used Joi schema validation and xss sanitization  
- Auto-reject and screening criteria are fully implemented  
- Match score includes breakdown by field and weighting  

## Employer 
- All logic uses ES Module syntax (`import/export`)  
- Image uploads are handled via `multipart/form-data`  
- Nested fields like `contact_Person`, `address` are parsed from strings to objects  
- Employers can only be created if the associated User exists and has role `Employer`  
- Job references are validated to ensure they exist in the database  
- Ready to move on to Candidate-Job Matching API and ATS Filtering Logic
